# Resume_app
Here are the step-by-step details to set up an end-to-end Jenkins pipeline for a python application using  Argo CD, Helm, and Kubernetes:
Overview:
 Define the pipeline stages:
    Stage 1: Checkout the source code from Git.
    Stage 2: Build and image from this python code.
    Stage 3: Push the image to manifest Git repo
    Stage 6: Deploy the application to a test environment using Helm.
    Stage 7: Run user acceptance tests on the deployed application.
    Stage 8: Promote the application to a production environment using Argo CD.

Prerequisites:

Python Resume application code hosted on a Git repository
Jenkins server - ( Hosted on EC2 )
Kubernetes cluster - (minikube installed on windows11 laptop)
Helm package manager -(installed on windows11 laptop)
Argo CD- (installed with Helm on minikube)


<h3>   1.AWS EC2 Instance </h3>   
 
Create EC2 instance. Select t3.large with security group having inbound allowing port 8080,22,8000.
Go to AWS Console
Instances(running)
Launch instances

 <h3> 2.   Install Jenkins. </h3>   
    
Pre-Requisites:

a. Java (JDK)
b. Run the below commands to install Java and Jenkins
c. Install Java

### Install Jenkins.

Pre-Requisites:
 - Java (JDK)

### Run the below commands to install Java and Jenkins

Install Java

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
   ```

Verify Java is Installed

   ```
   java -version
   ```

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

   ```
   curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
     /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
   echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
     https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
     /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install jenkins
   ```

**Note: ** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.

- EC2 > Instances > Click on <Instance-ID>
- In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
- Security groups
- Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed `All traffic`).

### Login to Jenkins using the below URL:

http://<ec2-instance-public-ip-address>:8080    [You can get the ec2-instance-public-ip-address from your AWS EC2 console page]

Note: If you are not interested in allowing `All Traffic` to your EC2 instance
      1. Delete the inbound traffic rule for your instance
      2. Edit the inbound traffic rule to only allow custom TCP port `8080`
  
After you login to Jenkins, 
      - Run the command to copy the Jenkins Admin Password - `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
      - Enter the Administrator password

Create First Admin User or Skip the step [If you want to use this Jenkins instance for future use-cases as well, better to create admin user]

## Install the Docker Pipeline plugin in Jenkins:

   - Log in to Jenkins.
   - Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
   - In the Available tab, search for "Docker Pipeline".
   - Select the plugin and click the Install button.
   - Restart Jenkins after the plugin is installed.

Wait for the Jenkins to be restarted.

  
  1. Install the necessary Jenkins plugins:
     Docker Pipeline pulgin
  
  2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline:
     2.1 In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job and configure it with the Git repository URL for the Java application.
     2.2 Add a Jenkinsfile to the Git repository to define the pipeline stages.

## 3. Docker Slave Configuration on EC2 instaance.

Run the below command to Install Docker

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io
   ```
    
### Grant Jenkins user and Ubuntu user permission to docker deamon.

   ```
   sudo su - 
   usermod -aG docker jenkins
   usermod -aG docker ubuntu
   systemctl restart docker
   ```

Once you are done with the above steps, it is better to restart Jenkins.

   ```
   http://<ec2-instance-public-ip>:8080/restart
   ```

The docker agent configuration is now successful.

## 4. Set up Docker Engine in windows.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b75232a1-0f80-4674-bdf9-c68b98aeb3de)

Note: By default Docker Engine is installed with 2GB memory, however later we may face issues while installing other resources. So we increased the memory to 4GB.
      Resources Advanced You are using the WSL 2 backend, so resource limits are managed by Windows. how to increase memory for Docker desktop. It is manged by wsl
To increase memory for Docker Desktop when using the WSL 2 backend, you need to configure the memory settings in the WSL 2 configuration file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Steps to Increase Memory for Docker Desktop:
   1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator:
   
   Right-click on the Start button and select "Windows Terminal (Admin)" or "Command Prompt (Admin)".
   
   2. Create or Edit the WSL 2 Configuration File:
   
   Open the .wslconfig file located in your user profile directory (`C:\Users
   
   \[YourUsername]\.wslconfig`). If the file doesn't exist, create it.
   
   You can use Notepad or any text editor to open or create the file:

  3. Add Memory Configuration: (In my case I had to create a .wslconfig file as it did not exist)
   
   Add the following lines to the .wslconfig file to set the memory limit for WSL 2:
   
   ```
   [wsl2]
   memory=4GB  # Adjust the memory allocation as needed 
   ```

## 5. Install minikube on the laptop. We have installed minikube with docker as a driver here. 

   ```
    winget install Kubernetes.minikube
   Found an existing package already installed. Trying to upgrade the installed package...

## 7. Set up Argo CD using Helm chart.
    Install Argo CD on the Kubernetes cluster.
    Set up a Git repository for Argo CD to track the changes in the Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests.
    Create a Helm chart for the Python application that includes the Kubernetes manifests and Helm values.
    Add the Helm chart to the Git repository that Argo CD is tracking.

Once Minikube setup done, Add the ArgoCD Helm repository to Helm. Run the following command:
   ```
   ADMIN@DESKTOP-LOTVTQN MINGW64 ~/GIT
   $ git clone https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm.git

   $ cd argo-helm/charts/argo-cd/
   ```

Just like other Kubernetes tools, ArgoCD requires a namespace with its name. Therefore, we will create a namespace for argocd named myargo
   ```
   ADMIN@DESKTOP-LOTVTQN MINGW64 ~/argo-helm/charts/argo-cd (main)
   $ kubectl create ns myargo
   namespace/myargo created
   ```
Update the dependencies in the chart by executing the below command.
   ```
   ADMIN@DESKTOP-LOTVTQN MINGW64 ~/argo-helm/charts/argo-cd (main)
   $ helm dependency up
   Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...

## 8. Set up Prometheus and Grafana on minikube using Helm chart.
## Configure Jenkins pipeline to integrate with Argo CD:
   6.1 Add the Argo CD API token to Jenkins credentials.
   6.2 Update the Jenkins pipeline to include the Argo CD deployment stage.

###. Run the Jenkins pipeline:
   7.1 Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to start the CI/CD process for the Python application.
   7.2 Monitor the pipeline stages and fix any issues that arise.
